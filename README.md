# My frigate config
## change to your mqtt details, change the rtsp for the camera
## for detection with CPU, uncomment the CPU part, and comment/delete the google coral part
### the camera's themself are 1080P and record in 1080p video, but detection happens forced at 720p (better since frigate is detecting at 300x300px, see frigate documentation for explanation)
